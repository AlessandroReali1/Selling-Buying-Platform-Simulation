The aim of this project is to show how a potential platform where sellers and buyers can inetract could work.

In particular, it is thought for a last-minute-market where shop owners, after registration, can put objects on the market indicating the number of items, the selling price, the original price and the missing days to the expiration. 

Similarely, each people, after registering to the platform, can pick a seller and choose what to buy from it.

Alternatively, the buyer can filter the market according to price range criteria, missing days to expiration or type of food and choose to buy something based from the filtered market.

Code is avalilable both in .py and in .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) format.
